Expressing grievances to authorities can be a daunting task for many students. The Students Grievance Redressal System (SGRS) provides a user-friendly web application that offers a confidential platform for students to lodge their grievances online. Once received, the authorities can acknowledge the complaint and resolve the issue. If the authority deems the grievance to be of a higher magnitude, it can be forwarded to a higher authority for further review and necessary action. The authorities are divided into three levels of hierarchy: Principal, Head of Department (HOD), and Tutor in increasing order of authority. SGRS makes it easier for students to voice their concerns and ensures that their problems are addressed effectively and efficiently.
